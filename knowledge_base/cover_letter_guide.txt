How to Write a Compelling Cover Letter:

1. Address the Hiring Manager: Avoid generic greetings like “To Whom It May Concern.” Research and use the correct name if possible.

2. Hook Early: Start with a strong, engaging opening that highlights your enthusiasm and top qualification.

3. Show Alignment: Connect your past experience to the company’s mission or the job role.

4. Keep It Focused: Limit to 3–4 short paragraphs. Do not repeat your resume verbatim.

5. End with a Call to Action: Express your interest in an interview and thank the reader for their time.
