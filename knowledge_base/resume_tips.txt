Resume Writing Tips for Jobseekers:

1. Tailor Your Resume: Customize your resume for each job application. Use keywords from the job description and highlight relevant skills and experience.

2. Keep It Concise: Ideally, limit your resume to one or two pages. Use bullet points instead of paragraphs.

3. Use Action Verbs: Begin each bullet point with powerful action words like “Developed,” “Managed,” “Analyzed,” etc.

4. Quantify Achievements: Include measurable outcomes such as “Increased conversion rate by 25%” or “Reduced churn by 15%”.

5. Prioritize Experience: List the most relevant experience first, especially if it aligns closely with the job role.

6. Proofread: Always double-check for grammar, spelling, and formatting issues before submitting your resume.
